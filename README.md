# Project Description

Hello this project is to give you a first glance in the day of a full stack data scientist. Steps we do:
- First, scrape all houses information you can get from the website ```https://www.athome.de/en/```. We limit ourselves to following features:
  -  sales price
  -  living surface
  -  land
  -  number of rooms 
  -  location

- Second, cleaning all the data including NaN values, formatting etc. 
- In the third step we will do some feature engineering like One-Hot Encoding and Handling Outliers etc. It depends all on the data we have.
